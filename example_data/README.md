# Example Data

This is some example data, and is just a fastq file that I had lying around (well, its from our favorite organism *Salmonella enterica* serovar LK5). There are 250 sequences in the left file and 75 sequences in the right file. Of the sequences in the right file, 50 should be the same as the left file.
